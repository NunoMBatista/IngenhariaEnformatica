    While scheduling an appointment, there are possible concurrency issues that need to be addressed.
    
    An update lock is used when checking the doctor and nurse availability to prevent other transactions from 
    adding appointments or surgeries to the database while the current transaction is running.
    
    In order to check if a doctor or a nurse are busy with another appointment, we check if they have any appointments APPOINTMENT_DURATION 
    before or after the selected date. Similarly, to check if a doctor or a nurse are busy with a surgery, we check if they have any
    surgeries APPONTMENT_DURATION before and SURGERY_DURATION after the selected date.
    
    Moreover, to avoid deadlocks, we need to make sure that the locks are acquired in the same order in all transactions,
    that is, first the doctor and then the nurses.
